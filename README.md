# News-App

The significance of news in society spans multiple dimensions. 
It serves as a crucial source to keep the public informed about events that could impact their lives. 
Beyond being informative, news also doubles as a form of entertainment, providing insight into distant places and occurrences. 
Additionally, it fosters a sense of connection among people. 
Often found in traditional newspapers or online platforms, news becomes a social hub attracting a large audience, making it an ideal advertising space. 
However, this commercial aspect might introduce biases or inconsistencies in reporting. More than ever, news takes various forms, 
extending beyond traditional television broadcasts to encompass websites, social media posts, and diverse media platforms. 

_The project's objective is to develop an app that exhibits approved news articles through its backend infrastructure. 
Users will have access to diverse news categories and can explore detailed information within the app. 
The primary aim is to craft a news feed application offering up-to-date, verified internet news on specific subjects, personalities, 
or geographic areas, ensuring users are consistently informed with the latest content._

This project relies on the Guardian API, a well-maintained service that delivers data in JSON format. 
The utilized functionalities encompass Navigation Drawer, Loaders, Fragments, ViewPager paired with TabLayout, Intent handling, Guardian API integration, JSON Parsing, Glide, CardView, RecyclerView, and SharedPreferences. 
Additionally, the Paging library is employed to progressively load news data. 
The ConstraintLayout facilitates the creation of intricate layouts with a streamlined view structure. 
Furthermore, third-party libraries such as Android Architecture Components, Android Data Binding, Retrofit, Json, OkHttp, 
ExoPlayer, Glide, Glide Transformations, and SimpleXmlConverter are harnessed to enhance functionality and usability.

_Irrespective of age, understanding the workings of the world holds immense value. 
Staying informed serves as a shield against potential deceit or manipulation. 
For instance, various angry expressions circulate online through memes or social network posts. 
Acquiring knowledge empowers one to discern the validity of seemingly absurd information and respond to it with a discerning and intellectual perspective._
